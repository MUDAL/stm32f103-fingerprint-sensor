# STM32F103-FINGERPRINT-SENSOR  
This repository contains sample codes for interfacing an stm32f103 microcontroller with a fingerprint sensor.  
The fingerprint library developed for this application was inspired by the **Adafruit Fingerprint Library**.  
The Adafruit library was ported from an Arduino environment to a Keil uVision environment.  
Optimizations were made to the library as data reception from the sensor was handled via Direct Memory Access (DMA).  
The stm32 microcontroller and fingerprint sensor communicate via the **UART** protocol.
